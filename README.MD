SIGNAL TRACKER

What is this?

This project gives the users the cellular signal strength in a particular location. It lets user have followers and allows the users followers to track users location.

How I did this?

I created an android project with Maps and Location APIs and used Friebase as the database, then created the code to return the cellular networks in an area along with their respective signal strength. Then created the Firebase database for each user to let them store followers.

How to run it?

Download the .apk file on an android device and run it.
